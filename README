 mBench benchmarking tool
 ========================

This application has been written for purposes of benchmarking and
getting/measuring the information from the host system. It can
get various CPU information (CPU affinity for the process - both
getting and setting, measured CPU speed, benchmarking CPU Dhrystone
and Whetstone values and also it can calculate the LinPack - former
version of LAPack), memory size and it can also perform disk and
network I/O benchmarking with capability to output the results as
a plain text or in csv or xml format.

The whole application is written in C language with requirements for
math library (libm) with some GPL pieces (Dhrystone, Whetstone, Linpack)
downloaded from the Internet and merged into this tool. The original
comments and authors have been preserved in the source files of those
pieces but the functions have been slightly modified to return values
of scores as floats.

Terminology
-----------

This app should be referred to as mBench.
